This repository contains code for building a diffusion model to compress the FossilNET dataset and generate imges. This can generally be useful for high quality samples, or for model diversity.


# Introduction 

Diffusion models are a type of generative model used in machine learning to generate data that is similar to the data on which they are trained . They work by adding noise to the available training data and then gradually reducing the noise until the generated data closely resembles the training data. Diffusion models are a rising class of generative models because of their power-generating ability and tractability . They can also improve upon existing generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by being less reliant on adversarial training.
