Biomedical NLP Tutorial: Introduction to NLP, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Relation Extraction (RE)

# Biomedical NLP Tutorial: Illuminating Insights from Textual Healthscapes 

## Welcome to the Biomedical NLP Tutorial Repository!

Embark on an exhilarating journey through the intricate terrain where the realms of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Biomedical Science converge. Our meticulously crafted tutorial unfurls the enigmatic nuances of NLP, unveils the power of Named Entity Recognition (NER), and uncovers the hidden treasures of Relation Extraction (RE) within the context of the riveting biomedical narrative.

This repository contains code for building a diffusion model to compress the FossilNET dataset and generate imges. This can generally be useful for high quality samples, or for model diversity.

# Building the Diffusion Model steps:
- Step 1: The forward process ==> Noise scheduler
- Step 2: Parameterized backward process ==> NN Model [U-Net (autoencoder)](https://amaarora.github.io/2020/09/13/unet.html)
- step 3: Positional Encoding ==> [timestep encoding](colab.research.google.com/drive/1niCAKS1dJ74_De8Nk_V3_Rx2tpNLadYD#scrollTo=dc8120e5)
