## List of Contents üìñ

1. **Introduction to NLP:**
   Lay the cornerstone by deciphering the art and science of NLP. Traverse the verdant landscapes of tokenization, linguistic preprocessing, and voyage through the lexicon of challenges unique to biomedical linguistics.

2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Biomedical Context:**
   Unleash the linguistic sleuth within you! Delve deep into the fascinating world of NER, where genes, diseases, chemicals, and a cornucopia of entities spring to life from the textual canvas. Embark on a quest to unravel their identities with the precision of a virtuoso. Leveraging the might of SpaCy, NLTK, and specialized biomedical NER tools to extract entities. Illuminate the dim alleys of biomedical text with your code's brilliance.

3. **Named Entity Normalisation (NEN) in Biomedical Text:**
   Normalising identified entities in text to their reference records in resources.
   
4. **Weaving Relations in Biomedical Text:**
   Enter the intricate dance of entities as they pirouette through the grammatical maze. With Relation Extraction, you're not just reading text‚Äîyou're deciphering the intricate web of connections between entities. Marvel at the tales spun by genes, proteins, and diseases as they waltz through sentences. Empower your code with PyTorch, and more. Cast your models into the textual sea, reeling in relationships with performance metrics as your guiding stars.
