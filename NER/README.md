## Welcome to the Biomedical NER Tutorial Repository! ðŸŒŸ

Unveil the secrets hidden within the labyrinth of biomedical text with our comprehensive Named Entity Recognition (NER) masterclass. This tutorial is your gateway to mastering the art of unraveling genes, diseases, chemicals, and a plethora of entities embedded in the intricate tapestry of biomedical discourse.

# Introduction 

Diffusion models are a type of generative model used in machine learning to generate data that is similar to the data on which they are trained . They work by adding noise to the available training data and then gradually reducing the noise until the generated data closely resembles the training data. Diffusion models are a rising class of generative models because of their power-generating ability and tractability . They can also improve upon existing generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by being less reliant on adversarial training.

# Building the Diffusion Model steps:
- Step 1: The forward process ==> Noise scheduler
- Step 2: Parameterized backward process ==> NN Model [U-Net (autoencoder)](https://amaarora.github.io/2020/09/13/unet.html)
- step 3: Positional Encoding ==> [timestep encoding](colab.research.google.com/drive/1niCAKS1dJ74_De8Nk_V3_Rx2tpNLadYD#scrollTo=dc8120e5)
